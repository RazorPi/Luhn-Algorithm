## Luhn-Algorithm
#by Free Code Camp

**DESC:** This is a code implementation of the Luhn Algorithm. 
**ABOUT:** The Luhn algorithm, also called the "modulus 10" algorithm, is a mathematical formula used to validate identification numbers, most commonly credit card numbers, by checking for simple errors like mistyping digits, making it a basic security measure to ensure data accuracy during inputting sensitive information like payment details; it works by performing a specific calculation on the digits of the number and checking if the result is divisible by 10, essentially verifying the number's validity based on a checksum digit

It was developed in the late 1950s. The Luhn algorithm is widely used to validate the authenticity of identification numbers, such as Social Security numbers. In finance, the Luhn algorithm facilitates electronic payments by rapidly identifying miss-entered credit card numbers.

#ABOUT THE CODE

This is the final code for the 36-step course on **Working with Numbers and Strings by implementing the Luhn Algorithm**. This course is the second module in the **Scientific Computing with Python Certification**. 

It is required to take this course in order. It will take no more than 1 to 2 hours, and most of the answers are in the "help" section.
